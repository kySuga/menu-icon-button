# Hamburger Menu Button – My Take
I had an idea pop into my head about 3—4 years ago (Future Proofing: Currently February, 2021) to “recreate” the hamburger menu button. Most likely the majority of people using the internet today are fully familiar with the three bar icon and do know that it is used for the menu/nav. However, I still wanted to bring my idea to life, and finally made the first steps in doing so in December of 2020. 

## Concept in Action
I first sketched a few concepts out on paper.

Then I sought out a font that was easy to read at nearly any size. I did my findings of fonts through Google Fonts and ultimately found [Lexend Zetta](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Zetta).

Lexend Zetta is a part of the [Lexend](https://www.lexend.com/) font family, created by Bonnie Shaver-Troup and Thomas Jockin. The purpose of the font lined up near perfectly for what I was looking for in a font. I did do some minor tweaking to the font, most notably to the ‘E’.

Once I found the font to use, I then jumped into [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) to create my concept digitally.

Having wanting to learn more about SVG, I exported it as such. The thought is that an SVG will provide flexibility in the styling, among other things.

Wanted it to be accessible


### Reasons behind the concept
1. I wanted to incorporate the word “Menu”, so the three bar icon's purpose was more easily understood
1. I didn't want to deviate too far away from the original
1. I wanted to represent its size, visually as a button, also providing an easier touch target on mobile
1. I wanted to pay homage to the original design, with the ‘E’

### Things I may do yet
* Tighten up SVG
* Need to verify accessibility
* Possibly tweak/refine design further
