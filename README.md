# Hamburger Menu Button – My Take
I had an idea pop into my head about 3—4 years ago (year now is 2021) to “recreate” the hamburger menu button so that it was more visually understood of what its purpose was. Most likely the majority of people using the internet today are fully familiar with the three bar icon and do know that it is for the menu/nav. However, I still wanted to bring it to life, and finally made the first steps in doing so in December of 2020. 

I first drew it out

Jumped into [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/)


I did my research of fonts through Google Fonts and found [Lexend Zetta](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Zetta)
I researched fonts for something legible and found [Lexend](https://www.lexend.com/), which coincidentally lined up perfectly with my wanting to suffice accessibility. I did some minor tweaking to the font, most notably to the ‘E’, but props to Bonnie Shaver-Troup and Thomas Jockin, the creators of the font.

Wanted to learn about SVG and made it into that

Wanted it to be accessible
